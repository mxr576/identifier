/**
 * DCE Security version, or version 2, UUIDs include local domain identifier,
 * local ID for the specified domain, and node values that are combined into a
 * 128-bit unsigned integer
 *
 * It is important to note that a version 2 UUID suffers from some loss of
 * fidelity of the timestamp, due to replacing the time_low field with the
 * local identifier. When constructing the timestamp value for date
 * purposes, we replace the local identifier bits with zeros. As a result,
 * the timestamp can be off by a range of 0 to 429.4967295 seconds (or 7
 * minutes, 9 seconds, and 496730 microseconds).
 *
 * Astute observers might note this value directly corresponds to 2^32 - 1,
 * or 0xffffffff. The local identifier is 32-bits, and we have set each of
 * these bits to 0, so the maximum range of timestamp drift is 0x00000000
 * to 0xffffffff (counted in 100-nanosecond intervals).
